## Other Notes

It took a little longer than I expected to wrap my head around state and props, and passing
methods/state to children and back using props, but at some point it finally clicked. I used basic
HTML element styling to focus on the purpose of the exercise and not get distracted by making it
look pretty. I needed all the time I could get to get things to make sense. Looking forward to
making something a bit more useful and nicer looking.
